# Continuous integration with Travis-CI

This guide briefly explains the idea of continuous integration (CI) and gives a
step-by-step guide to implement a simple CI setup using Travis CI and git (via
GitHub).

## Continuous integration

The idea of continuous integration is simply to merge developing effort into a
central, or integrated, environment<sup>1</sup>. The main reason is to avoid heterogenous
environments. Merging code from many developers can be hard because of local
dependencies or settings which ‘works on my machine’ (also known as integration
hell). In continuous integration code will be pushed to a different *clean* server
and tested, before being deployed to production.

In practices like eXtreme Programming (XP) where tests are put in place before
code, automated testing (with for instance JUnit) is exploited to act as a ‘guard’
to the production environment. If the tests are green the code can be released.
If they are not green, someone needs to cough up a good excuse for ruining
production code (and *not* release the code).

This becomes especially useful if testing can be integrated into the normal
development flow. A common method is to use versioning tools like git. You are
using this anyway, so in a sense you can get CI for free. Git is especially good
at this because it features commit hooks which can be run whenever someone
is committing. By using these hooks, tests can be set up to run automatically
when someone pushes to a shared repository.

This guide will show you how you can use CI with git (on GitHub) and Travis-CI.
In practice we will create a repository on GitHub which will feature a small
image showing green when the tests succeeds in the latest build and red when
they do not.

## Setting up a GitHub repository
For this exercise you should fork the following repository and create a copy under
your own GitHub account:
[https://github.com/Jegp/cphbusiness-sem3-ci](https://github.com/Jegp/cphbusiness-sem3-ci)

This is a very simple Java project which contains a function which returns the
integer 10 , along with a single test that verifies that the method actually returns
10. The project uses Maven to run the test and fetch dependencies. After forking
the project to your own GitHub account, try to pull it and run the test. It fails,
but do not fix it yet.

## What is Travis?
Travis is a service which simply builds code and runs test. The good thing is
that it is free for open-source projects, but do not get too attached to it. There
are many other CI services out there. Another popular alternative is Jenkins
which can be installed and run with private projects. For instance Jenkins could
be installed on a digital ocean server. However, that takes time to install so for
the purpose of this excercise we just use Travis.
Using Travis
The goal of this exercise is to tell our CI server (Travis) to keep a watch out
for code being pushed to your repository. Whenever Travis figures that out, he
should test it to see that some smug developer did write bad code. To figure
out which language and code to run, Travis uses a configuration file which must
be placed in the project root. Take a look at the file, it is called
``.travis.yml`` (notice the ``.`` in the beginning). 
As you can see it is very simple. First of all we
tell Travis what language we are using. Second, because JDK 8 is still relatively
new, we have to tell Travis to use the latest JDK 8.

Note that we actually do not write anything about execution in the ``.yml``
file. Since Maven is used so many places, Travis actually guesses that it is a Maven
project (because of the ``pom.xml`` file) and simply defaults to mvn test. Naturally,
this can be changed to do anything you want<sup>2</sup>. If you want to explore this have
a look at their documentation on using Java: 
[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/).
In this example we will only be using the default command.

## Setting up Travis-CI
Before running Travis we have have to connect your GitHub project to the CI
service. The easiest way to do this is to create an account on Travis using your
GitHub account and giving Travis access to all your repositories. This way
Travis can set up all the commit hooks for you. Of course, this will give Travis
access to your code so if this annoys you can trigger builds manually using this
guide<sup>3</sup>.

Create a user now via [https://travis-ci.org/](https://travis-ci.org/).

If you integrated your service with GitHub you should be faced with a list of
your GitHub projects after creating a user. Each project has a switch which tells
Travis-CI to listen for commits on that project. Find your forked project and
turn on Travis integration. If you get this step to work you should see a page
with a log file like this:

[https://travis-ci.org/Jegp/cphbusiness-sem3-ci/builds/172539255#L653]
(https://travis-ci.org/Jegp/cphbusiness-sem3-ci/builds/172539255#L653)

Notice line ``#653`` where our test fails. It expects 10 but gets 5. You should see
a similar log when your project runs. If you did not get it working, check out
[Travis for beginners](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners).
But please be critical. Use your own project names and languages (protip: 
you are not writing in php).

## Completing the guide
That was it. Really. Your project is now using CI. Every time you push to your
repository, Travis will rebuild and re-test. If you go to Travis you should see
your project listed and in the process of being built for the first time. To the
right of the project name is a grey icon. When the build is over it will tell you
that your build failed (d’uh). If you click on the icon, you can actually get a
status image which can be posted anywhere on the web. Do this, but instead
of getting an image URL, select ``Markdown`` and copy paste that line into the
``README.md`` file inside your GitHub project. Commit and push it. The GitHub
page for your project should now show a *Build failed*-image so people can see
how bad you are at testing.

Let us fix that. Try to make the tests succeed and push it to GitHub.  If
everything goes well, Travis should build another (successful) version and your
status image should go green.
